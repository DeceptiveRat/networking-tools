### Packet Sniffer
- need to verify if the pointer list functions are working properly
- current pointer list implementation makes it so that the head contains no pointer. Change it 
- change all print byte orders so they match wireshark output. Also, add hexadecimal notation not just decimal notation
- capture dns responses as well
- make compatible with other architectures by changing data types and such
- print the dns additional flags properly
- prettify printing packets
- organize directory
- verify IP checksum
- parse TCP header options
- multithread
- IP length can vary as well
- detect other protocols, i.e. HTTP, ICMP, SMTP, etc

### Internet Simulator
## change of purpose:
	used to be a proxy server with the purpose of hiding the end user from the server
	now a tool to view the exchanges between a program(malware) and the server(C2 server), much like burpsuite
	Any code that doesn't fit this new philosophy should be discarded (Version 2.0 contains all the discarded features and should be used if any code needs to be restored)

## clean up code:
- change multiple fprintf and printfs to one function 
- move functions to different files if possible

## add new feature:
- need to be able to let some packets through
	- log responses from servers
	- choose to let the responses through or not?
- create standard response 
	- one each for html, html + js, etc?
- improve the bulk_print function


- Change README.md to reflect new changes
- Change the license header in each file
