# Packet Sniffer
- need to verify if the pointer list functions are working properly
- current pointer list implementation makes it so that the head contains no pointer. Change it 
- change all print byte orders so they match wireshark output. Also, add hexadecimal notation not just decimal notation
- capture dns responses as well
- make compatible with other architectures by changing data types and such
- print the dns additional flags properly
- prettify printing packets
- organize directory
- verify IP checksum
- parse TCP header options
- multithread
- IP length can vary as well
- detect other protocols, i.e. HTTP, ICMP, SMTP, etc

# Internet Simulator
## change of purpose:
	used to be a proxy server with the purpose of hiding the end user from the server
	now a tool to view the exchanges between a program(malware) and the server(C2 server), much like burpsuite
	Any code that doesn't fit this new philosophy should be discarded (Version 2.0 contains all the discarded features and should be used if any code needs to be restored)

## clean up code:
- change multiple fprintf and printfs to one function 
- move functions to different files

## add new feature:
- need to be able to let some packets through
	- option to log responses from servers
	- option to not let reponse through
- create standard response 
	- option to use certain HTTP status code
	- option to return custom file
- parse other requests, not just GET
- improve the bulk_print function
- handle other protocols, not just HTTP
- the name client should be changed
- create cleanup header that contains all cleanup functions
- use cleanupConnections function
- print whitelist, add to whitelist while running program
- setupResponse function should have options to change default responses in at least the following headers:
	- Content-Encoding
- sendResponse function currently defaults to compressing file before sending
- change naming style to a consistent one, all CamelCase or _

- Change README.md to reflect new changes
- Change the license header in each file
- create a manual for each function
