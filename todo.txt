need to verify if the pointer list functions are working properly
current pointer list implementation makes it so that the head contains no pointer. Change it 
change all print byte orders so they match wireshark output. Also, add hexadecimal notation not just decimal notation
capture dns responses as well
make compatible with other architectures by changing data types and such
print the dns additional flags properly
prettify printing packets
organize directory
verify IP checksum
parse TCP header options
